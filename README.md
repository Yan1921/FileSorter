## Info
<!--
to have a self-incrementing Version Number you can use GitHub workflows
-->
+ **Version:** `0.9.0`
+ **language:** `Python`
+ **License:** `MIT`

<!-- TOC --><a name="constraints"></a>
## Constraints
+ As of version `0.9.0`, there is no input for the target and source path, so you need to change the string in the file
+ Also be wary of the fact there is no extensive error handling either, duplicate files may lead to unexpected results

<!---
after the 1. there are two spaces to tell the markdown interpreter to start a new line as an alternative you could also use the HTML tag "<br>"
also don't forget to change the git repo link to your own and do not forget the required format is: name/repo/branch.git

## Error handling
### As already stated under [Constraints](#constraints) there is no proper error handling implemented yet, once it is it will be documented here
<!--
Maybe error handling is a suboptimal name, it should also be documented how the code behaves in edge cases, etc.
